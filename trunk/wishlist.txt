Improving render performance

	Idea: Would redrawing the paper to only fit in the window be any help?
	
	Another idea: fragmenting the graphics
		Rewrite the system for bringing graphics from the model
			IModel.makeFragment(rect:Rectangle, colorPalette)
				Returns a Shape containing wire, tail and head graphics layers
				Colored in correctly
			IModel.makeHeatFragment(rect:Rectangle)
				Returns a Shape containing heatmap graphics layer
		Cut up the wire/head/tail /heat data into fragments
			IModel.spewRects(fWidth:Number, fHeight:Number)
				Breaks non-dead area of BitmapData into rects and returns them
			Fragments that are entirely off-screen should not be in the display list
				Paper will manage its display list after
					zooming
					reset
					dragging

Add comments to code in all the right places
	Class header
	Class sections
	Comments for methods
	Comments in complex functions

Test on Mac and PC
Then Rip out debug stuff
function, var cleanup

Use latest TDSI

Use fcsh instead of mxmlc in build scripts
	fcshctl

Example gallery
	Controller
		Detect an example gallery XML file
		If the XML is loaded successfully, add the gallery button in the view
	
	The dialog is an accordion list of documents sorted by author and name
	Highlighting a file name enables the Load button

Dumb down the buttons to Sprites
Wise up the dialogs to class instances
