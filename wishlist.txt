Replace WWDialog title/subtitle TextFields with TextLines

		Offsets the center
	width & height
		Centered
	get, set title
		If there is none, leave it out
	get, set subtitle
		If there is none, leave it out
	content sprite
	toolbar
	barberPole

Some bug fixes
	Thaw bug?
		Do some timers thaw when they shouldn't?
	Implement reset state
	Init GUI with state values
	Make sure CreditBox works properly
	Make sure Tyro doesn't leak
	
New announcer system
	Rename
	Announcers are blank speech bubble prompts
		On change,
			Announcer system takes screenshot
				Clears last screenshot
			Records generation
			Grow, flash with inverse CT
		On shrink,
			icon becomes eye button
				Hint is "Save announcer's picture"
				Clicking it opens a save box that uses label's name + generation of snapshot
		Announcer hint shows label, cropped thumb if there is one
		State should contain list of announcers
			List is erased when a new document is loaded
			List is not saved to shared object in AIR
Put Add Announcer in AIR app
Build API


Add comments to code in all the right places
	Class header
	Class sections
	Comments for methods
	Comments in complex functions

Improving render performance

	Idea: Would redrawing the paper to only fit in the window be any help?
	
	Another idea: fragmenting the graphics
		Rewrite the system for bringing graphics from the model
			IModel.makeFragment(rect:Rectangle, colorPalette)
				Returns a Shape containing wire, tail and head graphics layers
				Colored in correctly
			IModel.makeHeatFragment(rect:Rectangle)
				Returns a Shape containing heatmap graphics layer
		Cut up the wire/head/tail /heat data into fragments
			IModel.spewRects(fWidth:Number, fHeight:Number)
				Breaks non-dead area of BitmapData into rects and returns them
			Fragments that are entirely off-screen should not be in the display list
				Paper will manage its display list after
					zooming
					reset
					dragging

Test on Mac and PC
Then Rip out debug stuff
Reorder the functions and vars

Use fcsh instead of mxmlc in build scripts
	fcshctl

Example gallery
	Controller
		Detect an example gallery XML file
		If the XML is loaded successfully, add the gallery button in the view
	
	The dialog is an accordion list of documents sorted by author and name
	Highlighting a file name enables the Load button

Dumb down the buttons to Sprites
Wise up the dialogs to class instances
