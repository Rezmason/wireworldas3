AIR recent files list
	On a Mac, it has icons
		It also lists the name of the folder containing it

Get rid of embeds
	Load the horizontal Wireworld MCL
	Embed the font in the resource SWF
		EmbedFrucade.as
		Maybe Syphon should list all its fonts?

AIR app drag and drop
	Grabs file types from API
	
Test AIR app on Mac and PC

WireworldAndroid
	Get it to build with AIR 2.5
	Run the APK maker on the resulting SWF

Use fcsh instead of mxmlc in build scripts
	fcshctl

Example gallery
	Controller
		Detect an example gallery XML file
		If the XML is loaded successfully, add the gallery button in the view
	
	The dialog is an accordion list of documents sorted by author and name
	Highlighting a file name enables the Load button

When you get CS5, replace the text elements with TLF
	Then allow all UI elements to scale in the View

Use SVG instead of MovieClips in the FLA?
	What's the nicest way to represent View elements in an open source project?

Try working with the tree model again











Increase instance size limit (or not)
	BAMF - stitched together BitmapData objects
		Spits out a Shape that can represent it onscreen
	FilterModel and PixelBenderModel still limit the size to that of a BitmapData object
		They internally represent the data as BitmapData objects
